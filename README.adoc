SupernautFX is a generalized application framework that can be used to create JavaFX applications. It was developed for ConsensusJ Wallet-Framework, but is general-purpose and can be used to add Micronaut-based DI to any JavaFX application.

== Design Goals

NOTE: If a framework or library like this already exists, please https://github.com/ConsensusJ/wallet-framework/issues/1[let us know] ASAP!

We have researched https://github.com/mhrimaz/AwesomeJavaFX#frameworks[existing JavaFX frameworks] and haven't found anything that seems well-suited for the following criteria:


* Simple
** Minimizes abstraction and inheritance
** Avoids imposing architectural patterns
** Try to be more of a library than a framework
* Provides support for compile-time dependency injection (e.g. https://micronaut.io[Micronaut])
* Designed for Java apps shipped with a bundled runtime, (e.g. built with https://jdk.java.net/jpackage/[jpackage])
* Agressively tracks latest JDK for JavaFX, recent Android versions
** JDK 11 or later for JavaFX components
** JDK 8 (with multi-release JARs?) for base components and Android
* Minimal dependencies, minimal transitive dependencies
** Core components in pure Java (no additional language runtimes)
** Keep packaged/bundled apps as small as possible
** Minimal dependencies simplifies security review
** Potential for use by other frameworks
* AOT-friendly
** Avoids use of dynamic runtime features
** Friendly towards Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation platforms
*** Android
*** https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM]
* Provides support for first-class native-looking apps
** Follows each platform's UI guidelines
** First-class platform integration
** macOS integration
*** Support for https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/[App Sandbox]  and Mac App Store
*** Native-looking  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/menus/menu-bar-menus/[macOS Menu Bar Menus] (with help from https://github.com/codecentric/NSMenuFX[NSMenuFX])
*** Integration with Apple's https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging[unified logging system].
** May use additional libraries (e.g. NSMenuFX) on a specific platform
* Non-goal: reusable UI on desktop and mobile
** Android apps should have custom UI written with Android SDK
** iOS should use UIKit (adapter suggestions/contributions welcome)
* https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava] support (should this be optional or built-in?)
